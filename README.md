# example

Example for generated server and client, instrumented with OpenTelemetry.

* Force `go.mod` to have ogen in [tools.go](./tools.go) 
* Generate code by [gen.go](./gen.go)
* OpenTelemetry setup boilerplate in [go-faster/sdk](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-faster/sdk/app)
* Advanced `net/http` instrumentation in [internal/httpmiddleware](./internal/httpmiddleware)

```bash
docker compose up
```

You can open Grafana dashboard on http://localhost:3000 to observe telemetry.
For example, you can see client traces in [TraceQL explore][traces].
